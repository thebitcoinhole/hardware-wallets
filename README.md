# The Bitcoin Hole - Hardware Wallets

## Introduction

Hardware wallets are an essential tool for those who want to keep their bitcoin secure. These devices allow you to store your private keys offline, so they can’t be accessed by hackers or other online threats. But with so many hardware wallets on the market, it can be challenging to choose the right one for your needs.

This project goal is to have the more complete database of Hardware Wallets features, so they can be compared, helping users to choose wisely. The database is open-source, meaning anyone can collaborate to improve and correct any wrong data or add new wallets.

## Collaboration

Inside the `items` directory, there is a JSON file for each wallet, with all the data about it. To collaborate (adding missing data, fixing wrong data or adding a new wallet), just fork the repository and send a pull request with the changes.

## Website

The [thebitcoinhole.com](https://thebitcoinhole.com/) website offers a Hardware Wallet Comparison using this database. This website is the most comprehensive resource for comparing the features of top hardware wallets. It provides an in-depth analysis of each wallet’s security features, privacy, usability, compatibility, and more.
