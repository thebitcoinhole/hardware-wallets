Thus, the holder can make sure that the firmware installed on the card was produced by Tangem as well as that this is exactly the firmware that was checked by the auditor.",

Firstly, hot and warm wallets always have access to the key, which can be hacked. Secondly, having the key in an open place at home, work, or elsewhere is always a potential risk of compromise. Instead, Tangem offers a backup on 2 or 3 identical cards. The cards hold the keys and never share them with anyone; they are protected by an access code. Thus you have 2 or 3 duplicate keys for one vault (your wallet). They are equal; you can keep them in different places and use any of them. And the most important thing is that the keys have never been in public view. No bug or vulnerability in the software can expose the key at the moment it is generated. It is as safe and secure as possible."
